Method Overloading: Same name diff(number, type, or order of parameters).

In compile-time polymorphism, the decision about which method or function to call is made by the compiler based on the number, types, and order of arguments.


Method Overriding: to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the parent class.
Same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class.

In runtime polymorphism, the decision about which method to call is made during program execution based on the actual object's type.
